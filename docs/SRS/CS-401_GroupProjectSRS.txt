       1.4. Overview 
              The large banking system will provide users with an interface for deposits, and withdrawals from 
              their checking or savings accounts. The SU can do the same for the use, additionally, the SU 
              can also add or remove accounts, add people to an account, or take off people from an account. 


2. Overall Description
       2.1. Product Perspective 

       2.2. Product Architecture 
              The system will be organized into 5 major modules: the Operator module, the Account module, 
              the Server module, the Message, and the Client module. Note: System architecture should follow 
              standard OO design practices. 

       2.3. Product Functionality/Features 
              The high-level features of the system are as follows (see section 3 of this document for more 
              detailed requirements that address these features): 
              2.3.1. Users would be able to login to the system, and conduct actions such as:
                     a. Transfer funds to other accounts.
                     b. Manage and see current account balance and information. 
                     c. Make Virtual Deposits.
              2.3.2. Users are able to, with the help of a teller, do the following actions:
                     a. Withdraw money. 
                     b. Add, remove or edit access to their accounts. 
                     c. Make a deposit. 
              2.3.3. 


       2.4. Constraints 
              2.4.1. The software will be made in Java, hence the software will need to keep in mind the amount 
              of objects and keep it to a minimum at all times. 
              2.4.2. The software will be made for home use as well, hence we will need to keep in mind that 
              internet connection may be unstable/interrupted during use, and proper measures will need to be taken care of. 
              2.4.3. 

       2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies
              2.5.1. It is assumed that for client-teller interactions, both parties are physically together, 
              and that the customers are able to provide credentials and proof of identities to the tellers. 
              2.5.2. It is assumed that in-person deposits are monitored and assisted by a teller such that 
              any increase in bank balance is already verified to be correct. 
              2.5.3. It is assumed that there are no transfer fees for any transfer action.
