Software Requirements Specification


1.	Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a Large Banking System.

       1.1. Scope
       the large banking

       1.2. Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations 
       List any acronyms, terms etc. that need to be defined.
       SU - SuperUser, refers to the class of user with more permissions and functionalities.

       1.3. References 
       // not doing the diagrams this is for the design phase.
       //todo: we do

       1.4. Overview 
       The large banking system will provide users with an interface for deposits, and withdrawals from 
       their checking or savings accounts. The SU can do the same for the use, additionally, the SU 
       can also add or remove accounts, add people to an account, or take off people from an account. 


2. Overall Description 
       2.1. Product Perspective 

       2.2. Product Architecture 
       The system will be organized into 5 major modules: the Operator module, the Account module, 
       the Host module, the Message, and the Client module. Note: System architecture should follow 
       standard OO design practices. 

       2.3. Product Functionality/Features 
       The high-level features of the system are as follows (see section 3 of this document for more 
       detailed requirements that address these features): 

       2.4. Constraints 
       List appropriate constraints.
       Constraint example: Since users may use any web browser to access the system, no browser-
       specific code is to be used in the system. 

       2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies
       List appropriate assumptions 
       Assumption Example: It is assumed that the maximum number of users at a given time is 
       15,000. 

3. Specific Requirements 

       3.1. Functional Requirements 

       3.1.1. Common Requirements: 
       /*
                     3.1.1.1 Each account will have a unique serial ID used to identify the account.
              3.1.1.1.1 Serial ID is generated upon account initialization.
              3.1.1.1.2 Serial ID has a pattern for identification.
              3.1.1.1.3 Serial ID will be used to authenticate an Account, along with a user 
              generated passcode, which is initiated during account creation. (currently 
              disallowing changing passcode)
                     3.1.1.2 User may be registered to an account.
              3.1.1.2.1 Each registered user gains access to the account through 
              authentication with the account's reference list. 
              3.1.1.2.2 Adding and Removing users to account requires the SU.
                     3.1.1.2.3 Multiple Users may be registered to the same account.
                     3.1.1.2.4 The removal of the last User in an account will result in its closure.
              3.1.1.3 The ability to transfer funds.

       //move this part into account //Phil's note
       3.1.2. User Module Requirements: 
       //use 3.1.2 for operator and 3.1.2.* and 3.1.2.* for submodule user and super user, check 3.1.4 for example of format //Phil's note
       3.1.2. SuperUser (Admin) Module Requirements: 
              3.1.2.1 The superuser will have the ability to create new accounts for bankers
              3.1.2.2 If a checking account has not been active in the last 6 months, the 
              superuser has the ability to deactivate the said account. 
              3.1.2.3 If an account has a negative balance or a history of overdrafts, the 
              superuser will have the ability to declare the account closed.
              3.1.2.4 The superuser has the ability to assign roles that have appropriate 
              permissions
              3.1.3 Account Module Requirements:

       3.1.3. Checking Account Module Requirements: 
       //same thing with accounts, look at note on format in 3.1.2 //Phil's note
              3.1.3.1 The checking account has no limit on the number of withdrawals.
              3.1.3.2 The checking account has a $5 maintenance fee per month.

       3.1.3. Saving Account Module Requirements:
              3.1.3.1 Savings account has a withdrawal limit of 6 monthly withdrawals without a 
                     fee.
              3.1.3.2 If the user withdraws more than 6 times, they will be charged a $5 fee for 
              every withdrawal.
              3.1.5.2 The savings account will have a 0.10% annual increase rate.

       3.1.4 Message Module Requirements:
              3.1.4.1 Message between client and host through the internet will be encapsulated. 
                     3.1.4.1.1 Encapsulated data will be referred to a package.
                     3.1.4.1.2 Package will contain data, current address, receiving address, and type 
              of data.
              3.1.4.2 The encapsulated method will accept different type of information.
              3.1.4.3 The encapsulated data is able to be decapsulated by the recipient.
              3.1.4.4 There will be a processor, a sender, and a receiver on both side of the 
              connection.
                     3.1.4.4.1 Processor can encapsulate data into package or decapsulate package 
                     into data.
                     3.1.4.4.2 Sender will let processor create package from passed data and send 
                     package.
                     3.1.4.4.3 Receiver will listen on a designated port for packages and send them to 
                     processor to get data.
                     3.1.4.4.4 Processor, Sender, and Receiver can handle multiple packages 
                     synchronously.
