Software Requirements Specification


1.	Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a Large Banking System.

       1.1. Scope
              This document provides requirements for a Large Banking System. This software will support countless people 
              and interactions. The primary objective being, providing a GUI for the bank employees and users to interact 
              with their accounts. The bank has a server that stores all the data and is retrieved through the GUI.

       1.2. Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations 
              List any acronyms, terms etc. that need to be defined.
              List any acronyms, terms etc. that need to be defined.
              SU - SuperUser, refers to the class of user with more permissions and functionalities.
              GUI - Graphical user interface.
              User - A regular account user. Has the ability to draw or add funds from their account.
              Joint Account - Multiple users can share the same account.

       1.4. Overview 
              The large banking system will provide users with an interface for deposits, and withdrawals from 
              their checking or savings accounts. The SU can do the same for the use, additionally, the SU 
              can also add or remove accounts, add people to an account, or take off people from an account. 


2. Overall Description 
// Rohan's note: this whole section is still empty work on it as needed. 
       2.1. Product Perspective 

       2.2. Product Architecture 
              The system will be organized into 5 major modules: the Operator module, the Account module, 
              the Host module, the Message, and the Client module. Note: System architecture should follow 
              standard OO design practices. 

       2.3. Product Functionality/Features 
              The high-level features of the system are as follows (see section 3 of this document for more 
              detailed requirements that address these features): 

       2.4. Constraints 
              List appropriate constraints.
              Constraint example: Since users may use any web browser to access the system, no browser-
              specific code is to be used in the system. 

       2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies
              List appropriate assumptions 
              Assumption Example: It is assumed that the maximum number of users at a given time is 
              15,000. 

3. Specific Requirements

              disallowing changing passcode)
              3.1.1.2 User may be registered to an account.
              3.1.1.2.1 Each registered user gains access to the account through
